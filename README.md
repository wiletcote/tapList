# tapList
Frontend only webpage for adding, modifying, and storing beers currently on tap.

This app uses vanilla js, accesses the browser db with indexeddb, and styling with good ol' css.

No compiling, building, or deploying necessary.  Just open the page in a browser and start entering 
the beers you have on tap.

The brewery and beer you entered are saved in the browser db.  Available breweries and beers will be 
added to the dropdown as they are entered and can be selected to pre-populate available fields.
